Data visualization and Algorithms Techniques for Breast Cancer Prediction and Classification with High Accuracy Rates

## Problem Definition
Breast Cancer is one of a major issue that some of the women are facing today.
Earlier detection of cancer by performing detailed analysis based on the existing records which
may assist the physicians in providing a better treatment to their patients.

## Scope
The diagnosis of breast cancer is dependent on a variety of parameters. We aim to create the best
model for predicting breast cancer through preprocessing, feature extraction, data visualization
and prediction using breast cancer data. Various visualization techniques like violin plot, grid
plot, swarm plot and heat plot were utilized for proper feature extraction which has improved the
accuracy of our results. For the purpose of prediction, we have used algorithms like the random
forest, decision tree with single and multiple predictors, along with the commonly used statistical
model, logistic regression model.


## Conclusion:
In summary, Random-Forest classifier is the most accurate of all these models in terms of accurately diagnosing
breast cancer with careful feature selection using data visualization for this data set.
